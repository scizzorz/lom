# Heroes of Might & Mangoes

## Hard Decisions

* Using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) as the game framework
  * It's minimal, cross-platform, and easy to work with

## Flexible Decisions

* Game screen is 400x225 pixels
  * This is roughly the same as Stardew Valley, but at a 16:9 aspect ratio to
    fill widescreens.
